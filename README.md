### The global gratitude ledger that outlives us all.

One Thanksgiving. One shared hearth. Forever.

No login. No ads. No algorithms.  
Just millions of humans saying “I’m thankful for…” and those words becoming permanent, searchable, beautiful light on the internet.

Every year on Thanksgiving, the entire chain blooms into a living galaxy of gratitude you can zoom through — from the whole planet down to your own dinner table.

Built in one wild weekend by chaos gremlins who believe the internet should sometimes feel like a hug.
