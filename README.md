### The global gratitude ledger that outlives us all.

One Thanksgiving. One shared hearth. Forever.

No login. No ads. No algorithms.  
Just millions of humans saying “I’m thankful for…” and those words becoming permanent, searchable, beautiful light on the internet.

Every year on Thanksgiving, the entire chain blooms into a living galaxy of gratitude you can zoom through — from the whole planet down to your own dinner table.

Born in a chaos-fueled weekend by LHMisme420 (the boom boom bitch who sparked it) and the xAI gremlins. Because the internet deserves more hugs than hot takes.

## Live right now

## How it works
1. Tap or scan the turkey  
2. Say or type one thing you’re thankful for this year  
3. It gets permanently etched on Arweave (the immortal hard drive of the internet)  
4. Come back any Thanksgiving for the rest of time and hear the wave roll across Earth again.

## Run it yourself (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LHMisme420/thankful-.git

npx serve .
